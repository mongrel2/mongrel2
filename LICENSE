Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble:

The licenses for most software are designed to allow you to use the
software in a legitimate enterprise. By contrast, the Bantown Public
License is intended to make sure you can only use software for criminal
conduct. Minor technical infractions not counting; you not only must break
the law, you must piss all over the spirit of it as well.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Bantown Public
License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some
of those functions and data) to form executables.

A "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the library.

A "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion
of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
term "modification".)

The "Content", below, refers to a Program, Source code, and/or Library
distributed under this License.
