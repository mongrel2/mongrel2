 A Wishlist
===========

 * Use setuptools for distribution and installation.

 * Merge zcov tools into single 'zcov' executable, i.e. 'zcov scan', 'zcov
   genhtml', etc.

 * Switch to pygments for pretty printing code? Optional support for clang would
   be nice, ideally by contributing optional support for clang to pygments.
