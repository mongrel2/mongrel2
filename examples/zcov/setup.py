zcov is wrapper around the basic facilities of gcov for generating pretty
summaries for entire code bases. It is similar to lcov with an emphasis on nicer
HTML output (including, for example, branch coverage), and a greatly simplified
command line interface which tries to work around deficiencies in the metadata
provided by gcov.
