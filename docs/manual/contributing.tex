\chapter{Contributing}

You have gone through a complete description of all the features that Mongrel2 has right now,
but \emph{not} all the features it \emph{will} have.  I tend to write small software that does
exactly what it needs to do, and Mongrel2 is no different.  What you see here are the
majority of the things you need to do right now, and we'll be slowly adding things
people need.

If you'd like to help, then join the mongrel2@librelist.com mailing list and then read the
\href{http://mongrel2.org/wiki/contributor_instructions.html}{Contributor Instructions}.

Thanks,
