Also note that when we say "Mongrel2 Project" we don't mean the software Mongrel2.  You are free to say your company uses it, bases its tech on it, or that you sell services based on it.  What it means is you cannot say that the *project* and the people running it endorse your product or company without our permission.

The name "Mongrel2" is also trademarked by Zed A. Shaw, but you are free to use the term as long as you mention the (TM).  You of course don't have to be idiotic about it and sprinkle (TM) everywhere in your blog.  Just if you sell something with Mongrel2 in it, it'd be nice if when you tell people you mention that, you know, I wrote it and have the TM.  That's all.
